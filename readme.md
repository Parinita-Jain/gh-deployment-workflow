This is a sample project that demonstrates how to deploy a simple web page using **GitHub Actions**.

## üîß Project Structure

Once the GitHub Actions workflow is added, this page will be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## üí° What You‚Äôll Learn

- How to trigger GitHub Actions on push
- How to use GitHub Actions to deploy static websites
- Basics of CI/CD workflows

## ‚úÖ Output Preview
